# --- Data Source Settings ---

# 1. Waveform Source
# Select the source for waveform data:
# 'fdsn' = Download from the FDSN client specified in [client]
# 'sds'  = Load from a local SDS archive
waveform_source = fdsn

# Path to the root of your SDS archive (only used if waveform_source = sds)
# Example: /mnt/seiscomp/archive
archive_path = /path/to/your/sds/archive

# 2. Inventory Source
# Select the source for inventory data: 'fdsn' or 'local'
inventory_source = local

# Path to local inventory files (only used if inventory_source = local)
# This should be a folder containing .xml or .dataless files
# Example: /opt/seiscomp/etc/inventory
inventory_path = /path/to/your/inventory/folder

# --- Output Paths ---
# These are the root directories where output files will be saved

# --- Performance Settings ---
# Leave blank to use the default (approx. 1/3 of your CPUs)
# Or, set a specific number of processes, e.g., 16
cpu_number_used = 16

# Choice of spike algorithm:
# 'fast'      = NumPy method. Very fast, but high RAM usage.
# 'efficient' = Pandas method. Very slow, but low RAM usage.

# {station_code} will be replaced with the station name.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# FDSN Client Credentials
# (Used if waveform_source or inventory_source is 'fdsn')
#
# You can define multiple client sections for different FDSN endpoints:
# - [client] = default FDSN client used by global waveform_source setting
# - [client2], [client3], etc. = additional clients for specific stations
# - [inventory_client], [inventory_client2], etc. = FDSN clients for inventory only
#
# Use source.cfg to map specific stations to these clients
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
[client]
url = http://your-fdsn-server.com
user = your_username
password = your_password

# Example: Additional FDSN client for specific stations
# Uncomment and configure as needed
# [client2]
# url = https://service.iris.edu
# user = your_username
# password = your_password

# Example: Separate FDSN client for inventory metadata
# Use this when you want different endpoints for waveforms vs inventory
# [inventory_client]
# url = http://your-fdsn-server.com
# user = your_username
# password = your_password

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# SDS Archive Paths (for waveform_source = 'sds')
# You can define multiple archive sections for different SDS roots
# Use source.cfg to map specific stations to these archives
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# [archive]
# archive_path = /path/to/primary/archive

# [archive2]
# archive_path = /path/to/secondary/archive

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Local Inventory Paths (for inventory_source = 'local')
# You can define multiple inventory sections for different inventory locations
# Use source.cfg to map specific stations to these paths
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# [inventory]
# inventory_path = /path/to/primary/inventory

# [inventory2]
# inventory_path = /path/to/secondary/inventory
