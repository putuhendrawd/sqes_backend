# This file captures shell errors and Python crashes from the cron job.
# 
# Normally this file will be empty if everything runs successfully.
# 
# Example errors you might see here:
# - "python: command not found" - if Python path is incorrect
# - "Permission denied" - if script is not executable
# - "No such file or directory" - if project path is wrong
# - Segmentation faults or Python crashes before logging initializes
#
# Note: Application-level errors (like FDSN download failures, database 
# connection errors, etc.) appear in logs/log/YYYYMMDD.log, NOT here.
